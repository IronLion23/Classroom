<a name=3></a>INTRODUCTION<br/>
On September 25, 2015, President Barack Obama and Chinese&#160;<br/>President Xi Jinping agreed that neither government would&#160;<br/>“conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of intel&#160;ectual&#160;<br/>property”1&#160;for an economic advantage. Some observers hailed the&#160;<br/>agreement as a game changer for U.S. and Chinese relations, while&#160;<br/>skeptics saw this as little more than a diplomatic formality unlikely&#160;<br/>to stymie years of state-sponsored intel&#160;ectual property theft.2 3&#160;<br/>Since the agreement, there has been much discussion and&#160;<br/>speculation as to what impact, if any, it would have on Chinese&#160;<br/>cyber operations.<br/>
To investigate this question, FireEye iSIGHT&#160;<br/>
Between September 2015 and June 2016,&#160;<br/>
Intelligence reviewed the activity of 72 groups&#160;<br/>
we observed 13 active China-based groups&#160;<br/>
that we suspect are operating in China or oth-<br/>
conduct multiple instances of network compro-<br/>
erwise support Chinese state interests. Going&#160;<br/>
mise against corporations in the U.S., Europe,&#160;<br/>
back nearly three and a half years to early 2013,&#160;<br/>
and&#160;Japan.&#160;During&#160;this&#160;same&#160;timeframe,&#160;other&#160;<br/>
our analysis paints a complex picture, leading&#160;<br/>
China-based groups targeted organizations in&#160;<br/>
us to assess that a range of political, economic,&#160;<br/>
Russia and the Asia Pacific region. However,&#160;<br/>
and other forces were contributing to a shift&#160;<br/>
since mid-2014, we have observed an overall&#160;<br/>
in Chinese cyber operations more than a year&#160;<br/>
decrease in successful network compromises&#160;<br/>
prior to the Xi-Obama agreement.&#160;<br/>
by China-based groups against organizations&#160;<br/>in the U.S. and 25 other countries. These shifts&#160;<br/>have coincided with ongoing political and&#160;<br/>military reforms in China, widespread exposure&#160;<br/>of Chinese cyber activity, and unprecedented&#160;<br/>action by the U.S. Government.<br/>

<a name=4></a><b>KEY FINDINGS</b><br/>
13<br/>
Between late-2015 and mid-2016,&#160;<b>13 suspected China-based groups have compromised&#160;<br/>corporate networks in the U.S., Europe, and Japan,</b>&#160;and targeted government, military,&#160;&#160;<br/>and commercial entities in the countries surrounding China.&#160;<br/>
25<br/>
Since mid-2014, we have seen a&#160;<b>notable decline in China-based groups’ overall intrusion&#160;<br/>activity against entities in the U.S. and 25 other countries.</b>&#160;We suspect that this shift&#160;&#160;<br/>in operations reflects the influence of ongoing military reforms, widespread exposure&#160;&#160;<br/>of Chinese cyber operations, and actions taken by the U.S. government.&#160;<br/>
Since taking power in late 2012, Chinese President Xi Jinping has implemented&#160;<b>significant&#160;<br/>military reforms intended to centralize China’s cyber elements</b>&#160;and support a greater&#160;&#160;<br/>use of network operations.&#160;<br/>
Public reports in recent years have&#160;<b>exposed Chinese cyber operations</b>&#160;and heightened&#160;&#160;<br/>public awareness of China’s engagement in economic espionage. This likely provided&#160;&#160;<br/>the U.S. government with political support to&#160;<b>publicly confront China</b>&#160;over the issue.<br/>
In 2014, the U.S. government began to take&#160;<b>unprecedented measures in response to claims&#160;<br/>of Beijing’s cyber-enabled economic espionage.</b>&#160;Although many in the U.S. initially doubted&#160;<br/>that these actions would have any effect, they may have&#160;<b>prompted Beijing to reconsider&#160;&#160;<br/>the execution of its network operations.&#160;</b><br/>
<b>We have not seen evidence of a coordinated shift in the behavior of recently active&#160;&#160;<br/>China-based&#160;groups</b>—tactical changes appear to be specific to each group’s mission&#160;&#160;<br/>and resources, and in response to public exposure of its cyber operations.<br/>

<b>CHINESE&#160;DOMESTIC&#160;REFORMS</b><br/>
INFLUENCING&#160;&#160;<br/>
China has undergone significant changes under Xi’s leadership, including&#160;<br/>a massive centralization of presidential power, reforms restructuring the&#160;<br/>country’s military capabilities, and growing regional security concerns.4&#160;Xi’s&#160;<br/>
CHINESE CYBER&#160;&#160;unrivaled authority has allowed him to advance a large-scale reorganization&#160;<br/>
of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). The reforms aim to improve China’s&#160;<br/>ability to conduct joint operations and win “informationized”5&#160;wars,&#160;deempha-<br/>sizing the army in favor of a stronger focus on cyber and maritime capabilities&#160;<br/>
OPERATIONS<br/>
and space assets.&#160;<br/>Since 2012, Xi has also actively cracked down on government and military&#160;<br/>elements using state resources for their own agendas.6&#160;<br/>

<a name=6></a><b>CHINESE SECURITY CONCERNS</b><br/>
China is also facing pressing security concerns within the region, particularly&#160;<br/>from Taiwan, Japan, and claimants in the South China Sea dispute. &#160;Taiwan’s&#160;<br/>recent election of the pro-independence Democratic People’s Party has al-<br/>most certainly prompted concern in Beijing. Despite the Taiwanese president’s&#160;<br/>pledge to “maintain the status quo with China,” Beijing almost certainly views&#160;<br/>the party’s pro-independence mindset as a threat to its territorial sovereignty&#160;<br/>and future security. &#160;In addition, Japan’s increased willingness to defend its&#160;<br/>regional interests, particularly through expanding the role of its Self-Defense&#160;<br/>Forces, may allow Japan to balance China more effectively, curbing Beijing’s&#160;<br/>influence and regional ambitions. Lastly, territorial disputes in the South China&#160;<br/>Sea have intensified over the past few years, due in part to U.S. displays of&#160;<br/>military power and China’s own island-building activities.&#160;<br/>

We examined the incidence of network compromises&#160;&#160;<br/>by suspected China-based actors dating back nearly&#160;<br/>three and a half years, to early 2013. Our data is based&#160;<br/>on our visibility, which includes a combination of sources&#160;<br/>(Mandiant Services engagements, FireEye as a Service,&#160;&#160;<br/>and FireEye’s Dynamic Threat Intelligence data) that&#160;<br/>provide us with both a breadth and depth of coverage.&#160;<br/>While our visibility may vary from region to region&#160;<br/>depending on our customer base, we believe it provides&#160;&#160;<br/>a reasonable representation of Chinese cyber activity.<br/>

Our data analysis reveals an overall decline&#160;&#160;<br/>in China-based intrusion activity against private&#160;&#160;<br/>and public sector organizations since mid-2014.&#160;<br/>

<b>THE BASIS FOR ‘CHINA-&#160;BASED’</b><br/>
Attributing cyber activity to a geographic location is a&#160;<br/>complex process. We are never fortunate enough to be&#160;<br/>presented with a “smoking gun”; instead we rely on the&#160;<br/>careful accumulation of multiple pieces of evidence in&#160;<br/>sufficient quantity over time. Inevitably, as we discover&#160;<br/>more about specific sets of activity, we frequently find links&#160;<br/>
total&#160;62<br/>
&#160;compromises&#160;that show us commonalities between these sets, and allow&#160;<br/>
us to assess that the same actors are behind two formerly&#160;<br/>
182<br/>
distinct groups.&#160;<br/>
incidents&#160;&#160;<br/>
Some of the factors we consider when assessing a group’s&#160;<br/>
occurred on&#160;&#160;<br/>
location and potential sponsorship include, but are not&#160;<br/>
U.S&#160;entities’&#160;<br/>
limited to, the following:<br/>
networks<br/>
80<br/>
<b>•&#160;Operations:&#160;</b>The scope or scale of the group’s operations&#160;<br/>
incidents&#160;&#160;<br/>
and their level of sophistication (e.g., adaptability, stealth,&#160;<br/>
affected&#160;entities&#160;<br/>
or access to advanced tools or exploits). What type of&#160;<br/>
in the following&#160;<br/>
group would have the resources (personnel, funding,&#160;<br/>length of operations) to conduct this activity?<br/>
countries<br/>
<b>•&#160;Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs):</b>&#160;Does the&#160;<br/>
Of the 262 compromises, 182 affected U.S. entities’&#160;<br/>
group use tools and methodologies that are generic, pub-<br/>
networks while 80 affected entities outside of the U.S.&#160;<br/>
licly available, or widely known, or ones that are unique,&#160;<br/>
This includes one instance where a suspected China-<br/>
novel, or not typically seen? Such TTPs may make a group&#160;<br/>
based group stole information from a privately held&#160;<br/>
more or less distinctive, and potentially act as a “finger-<br/>print” allowing us to link together disparate incidents.<br/>
Chinese conglomerate. These compromises affected&#160;<br/>a total of 25 other countries in Europe, Asia, South&#160;<br/>
<b>•&#160;Operational&#160;Details:</b>&#160;Groups operate with varying levels&#160;<br/>
America, the Middle East, and Africa. Following are&#160;&#160;<br/>
of stealth and anonymity. At one end are actors who&#160;<br/>
the specific countries, listed by frequency of incident:<br/>
make no attempt to hide their tools or operations, and&#160;<br/>instead rely on victims’ inability to respond effectively for&#160;<br/>
Great&#160;Britain<br/>
Brazil<br/>
Japan<br/>
China<br/>
their success. At the other end are actors who take great&#160;<br/>
Canada<br/>
Colombia<br/>
pains&#160;to&#160;appear&#160;innocuous&#160;and&#160;limit&#160;or&#160;delete&#160;evidence&#160;of&#160;<br/>
Italy<br/>
Egypt<br/>
their presence. However, even the most careful operators&#160;<br/>
Switzerland<br/>
France<br/>
make mistakes that can expose key details. Clues such&#160;<br/>

Despite the decline, China-based threat groups continue to operate. Through late 2015 and 2016, we saw suspected&#160;<br/>China-based&#160;groups&#160;compromise&#160;corporations’&#160;networks&#160;in&#160;the&#160;U.S.,&#160;Europe,&#160;and&#160;Japan,&#160;while&#160;also&#160;targeting&#160;<br/>government, military, and commercial entities in the countries surrounding China.&#160;<br/>
Three groups compromised the networks of four firms headquartered in the&#160;&#160;<br/>U.S., Europe, and Asia that are involved in the manufacturing of semiconductors&#160;<br/>and chemical components used in the production of semiconductors. We did not&#160;<br/>observe data theft in any of these instances. However, in 2012, we saw one of these&#160;<br/>

After&#160;compromising&#160;a&#160;network,&#160;the&#160;group&#160;moved&#160;laterally,&#160;harvested&#160;credentials,&#160;<br/>

In what appeared to be an attempt to obtain information related to U.S. military&#160;<br/>
March – May 2016<br/>
projects,&#160;a&#160;group&#160;deployed&#160;backdoors&#160;to&#160;a&#160;victim’s&#160;web&#160;servers&#160;and&#160;harvested&#160;<br/>credentials at a U.S. government services company.&#160;<br/>
After compromising the network of a U.S. high-tech corporation, the group&#160;&#160;<br/>
August 2015 – March 2016<br/>
began collecting data about navigational software in RAR files, likely in&#160;<br/>preparation for transferring the data from the environment.<br/>
A group compromised a U.S. healthcare organization and deployed&#160;&#160;<br/>
March 2016<br/>
a backdoor providing continued access to the network.<br/>
In December 2012 a group breached the network of a U.S. software company.&#160;&#160;<br/>In 2014, they returned to the network, packaged data on navigational projects&#160;<br/>
December&#160;2012-March&#160;2016<br/>
in likely preparation for removing it from the network. The same group returned&#160;<br/>again in early 2016 and viewed files related to the same project, but they did not&#160;<br/>transfer any data out of the network.&#160;<br/>
In early 2016, a group prepared to transfer files out of the network&#160;&#160;<br/>
October 2015 – February 2016<br/>
of a European consulting company. The files were related to technology&#160;&#160;<br/>used in U.S. military projects.<br/>
At a European logistics company a group collected user credentials during&#160;&#160;<br/>
January&#160;2016<br/>
an intrusion into the network.<br/>
After a group breached the network of a major media company, they stole user&#160;<br/>
October&#160;–&#160;November&#160;2015<br/>
credentials, probably with the intent to expand their access within the network.&#160;<br/>
At&#160;a&#160;U.S.&#160;aerospace&#160;company,&#160;a&#160;group&#160;deployed&#160;a&#160;backdoor,&#160;conducted&#160;network&#160;<br/>
September&#160;–&#160;October&#160;2015<br/>
reconnaissance,&#160;and&#160;harvested&#160;user&#160;credentials,&#160;likely&#160;in&#160;preparation&#160;for&#160;continued&#160;<br/>activity. We did not observe the group transferring data from the network.<br/>

THE MONOLITH:<br/><b>SOME&#160;GROUPS&#160;REVAMP&#160;OPER&#160;ATIONS&#160;&#160;&#160;</b><br/>
<b>WHILE OTHERS CARRY ON</b><br/>
We have strong indications that the 72 groups we have&#160;<br/>
Despite an overall decline in China-based threat activity,&#160;<br/>
observed are based in China or otherwise support Chinese&#160;<br/>
multiple groups actively conduct network intrusions, while&#160;<br/>

ernment. The Chinese landscape, frequently characterized&#160;<br/>

as monolithic and rigidly state-directed, is composed of a&#160;<br/>
coordinated, widespread shifts in how these groups oper-<br/>
wide range of groups, including government and military&#160;<br/>
ate. Changes in operations are more likely to be driven by&#160;<br/>
actors, contractors, patriotic hackers, and even criminal el-<br/>
individual groups’ specific circumstances, resources, and&#160;<br/>
ements. Occasionally, aligned interests between two types&#160;<br/>
needs.&#160;For&#160;example:<br/>
of groups may drive activity that blurs the lines between&#160;<br/>direct&#160;government&#160;sponsorship&#160;and&#160;independent&#160;action.&#160;<br/>
•&#160;From mid-2014 through June 2016, a group did not&#160;<br/>
For example, during territorial disputes, patriotic hackers&#160;<br/>
make any changes to the tools and infrastructure that&#160;&#160;<br/>
may conduct targeting activity that is indistinguishable&#160;<br/>
it used to compromise chemical companies in Germany,&#160;<br/>
from that of government forces. As a result, it is often&#160;&#160;<br/>
Japan,&#160;and&#160;the&#160;U.S.<br/>
difficult to determine the extent to which activity is&#160;&#160;<br/>
•&#160;From 2009 until 2014, a group relied heavily on the&#160;<br/>

same set of tools to compromise victims in multiple&#160;&#160;<br/>industries. Then in late 2014, a report exposing one of&#160;&#160;<br/>

CONCLUSION<br/>In 2013, when we released the APT1 report exposing a PLA cyber espionage operation, it seemed like a quixotic effort&#160;<br/>to impede a persistent, well-resourced military operation targeting global corporations. Three years later, we see a&#160;<br/>threat that is less voluminous but more focused, calculated, and still successful in compromising corporate networks.&#160;<br/>Rather than viewing the Xi-Obama agreement as a watershed moment, we conclude that the agreement was one point&#160;<br/>amongst dramatic changes that had been taking place for years. We attribute the changes we have observed among&#160;<br/>China-based groups to factors including President Xi’s military and political initiatives, the widespread exposure of&#160;&#160;<br/>Chinese cyber operations, and mounting pressure from the U.S. Government.&#160;<br/>
Yet China is not the only actor in transition: we’ve observed multiple state-backed and other well-resourced groups&#160;&#160;<br/>develop&#160;and&#160;hone&#160;their&#160;operations&#160;against&#160;corporate&#160;and&#160;government&#160;networks.&#160;The&#160;landscape&#160;we&#160;confront&#160;today&#160;&#160;<br/>is far more complex and diverse, less dominated by Chinese activity, and increasingly populated by a range of other&#160;<br/>criminal and state actors.<br/>
