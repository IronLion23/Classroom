#   this program simply loops through the headlines for https://thehackernews.com/, downloads them
#   and writes only the text of the blog articles to a file so they can be read aloud with a 
#   text-to-speech program to facilitate multi-tasking.
# note:
#   this is a stable, dirty version of what is a work in progress; 
#   as more files are consumed, it will be improved.
