Incident response is a structured process organizations use to identify and deal with cybersecurity incidents. Response includes several stages, including preparation for incidents, detection and analysis of a security incident, containment, eradication, and full recovery, and post-incident analysis and learning.
Well present the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) framework for incident response, and show how to build your incident response plan according to NIST principles, with templates and real life examples you can follow to get started.

What is the NIST Incident Response Framework?
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is an agency operated by the United States Department of Commerce which provides standards and recommendations for many technology sectors.
Within NIST, the Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) is responsible for developing standards and measurement methods for IT, including information security. ITL developed an influential model for incident response (IR), the Computer Security Incident Handling Guide (
Special Publication 800-61 ).
The NIST incident response process is a cyclical activity featuring ongoing learning and advancements to discover how to best protect the organization. It includes four main stages: preparation, detection/analysis, containment/eradication, and recovery.
What is an Incident Response Plan?
Incident response is an organizational process that enables timely, effective response to cyberattacks. The incident response process includes identifying an attack, understanding its severity and prioritizing it, investigating and mitigating the attack, restoring operations, and taking action to ensure it wont recur.
An incident response plan (IRP) is a set of documented procedures detailing the steps that should be taken in each phase of incident response. It should include guidelines for roles and responsibilities, communication plans, and standardized response protocols.
7 Reasons You Need an Incident Response Plan
A strong incident response process can dramatically reduce the damage caused to an organization when disaster strikes. An incident response plan helps codify and distribute the incident response plan across the organization.
Here are the main reasons you must have a strong incident response plan in place:
Prepares you for emergency security incidents happen without warning, so its essential to prepare a process ahead of time
Repeatable process without an incident response plan, teams cannot respond in a repeatable manner or prioritize their time
Coordination in large organizations, it can be hard to keep everyone in the loop during a crisis. An incident response process can help achieve this
Exposes gaps in mid-sized organizations with limited staff or limited technical maturity, an incident response plan exposes obvious gaps in the security process or tooling which can be addressed before a crisis occurs
Preserves critical knowledge an incident response plan ensures critical knowledge and best practices for dealing with a crisis are not forgotten over time and lessons learned are incrementally added
Practice makes perfect an incident response plan creates a clear, repeatable process that is followed in every incident, improving coordination and effectiveness of response over time
Documentation and accountability an incident response plan with clear documentation reduces an organizations liabilityit allows you to demonstrate to compliance auditors or authorities what was done to prevent the breach
Key Roles in an Incident Response Team
To execute an incident response plan, you need an incident response team . In a large organization the roles may be carried out by full-time employees or entire teams; in smaller organizations, they can be filled by employees with other full-time roles, who also participate in the incident response process.
The following are essential roles within the team:
Incident response managers have at least two members of staff responsible for approving the incident response plan and coordinating activity when an incident occurs.
Security analysts review alerts, identify possible incidents and perform an initial investigation to understand the scope of an attack.
Threat researchers responsible for providing contextual information around a threat, using information from the web, threat intelligence feeds, data from security tools, etc.
Other stakeholders these can include senior management or board members, HR, PR, and senior security staff such as the Chief Information Security Office (CISO)
Third parties such as lawyers, outsourced security services, or law enforcement agencies.
NIST Recommendations for Organizing A Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT)
The NIST Computer Security Incident Handling Guide provides in-depth guidelines on how to build an incident response capability within an organization. It covers several models for incident response teams , how to select the best model, and best practices for operating the team.
Incident Response Team Models
NIST offers three models for incident response teams:
Central centralized body that handles incident response for the entire organization.
Distributed multiple incident response teams, with each one responsible for a physical location (e.g. branch office), a department or a part of the IT infrastructure
Coordinated a central incident response team that works together with distributed incident response teams, without having authority over them. The central team serves as a knowledge center and offers assistance with complex, critical, or organization-wide incidents.
Within each of these models, staff can be employees, partially outsourced, or fully outsourced. Employees can also be full- or part-time.
Selecting a Team Model
NIST provides several considerations for selecting an incident response model:
Does incident response need to be available 24/7? Do incident responders need to be on-site or is phone contact sufficient? Real-time availability and on-site presence is best because it allows immediate response to an incident, which can prevent damage.
Should staff be part-time or full-time? Part-time employees can be used to make up a virtual incident response team, like a volunteer emergency response unit. When an incident occurs, the IT help desk can be the first point of contact. They can perform an initial investigation, rapidly call on incident response team members, and whomever is available can respond to the incident.
Should staff be security experts? What level of expertise is needed? Incident response requires broad knowledge of IT systems, communication protocols, attack techniques, and also the organizations environment, systems and procedures. Outsourced teams typically have stronger security expertise, but employees have a better understanding of the IT environment, normal vs. malicious behavior, and of which systems are critical, etc.
How much will the incident response team cost ? Because incident responders need special expertise, and are often required to be on-site 24/7, they can represent a major investment. Managed Security Service Providers (MSSP) can also be costly, and there is an additional cost of security tooling, physical facilities and secure communication methods.
How to Organize Incident Response
The NIST Incident Response Guide provides several guidelines for organizing and operating an incident response unit.
Establish a formal incident response capability
Even if your organization is small, take incident response seriously and establish a formal incident response body. If it is not possible to establish a full-time incident response team, create a virtual team with part-time staff, and give this team full authority and responsibility. This will dramatically improve your capability to respond when a cyberattack strikes.
Create an incident response policy
This is a precursor to the incident response plan which lays out the organizational framework for incident response. It specifies what is considered a security incident, who is responsible for incident response, roles and responsibilities, documentation and reporting requirements.
Define an incident response plan
According to NIST methodology, an incident response plan is not merely a list of steps to perform when an incident happens. It is a roadmap for the organizations incident response program, including short- and long-term goals, metrics for measuring success, training and job requirements for incident response roles.
Develop incident response procedures
These are the detailed steps incident response teams will use to respond to an incident. They should be based on the incident response policy and plan and should address all four phases of the incident response lifecycle: preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication and recovery, and post-incident activity.
The NIST Incident Response Life Cycle
NIST defines a four-step process for incident response, illustrated in the diagram below. The NIST process emphasizes that incident response is not a linear activity that starts when an incident is detected and ends with eradication and recovery. Rather, incident response is a cyclical activity, where there is continuing learning and improvement to discover how to better defend the organization.
Source: 
NIST
After every incident there is a substantial effort to document and investigate what happened during the incident, to feed back to earlier stages and to enable better preparation, detection and analysis for future incidents.
There is also a feedback loop from the containment and eradication step to detection and analysismany parts of an attack are not fully understood at the detection stage and are only revealed when incident responders enter the scene. These lessons can help the team detect and analyze attacks more fully the next time around.
The Four Steps of NIST Incident Response
1. Preparation
To prepare for incidents, compile a list of IT assets such as networks, servers and endpoints, identifying their importance and which ones are critical or hold sensitive data. Set up monitoring so you have a baseline of normal activity. Determine which types of security events should be investigated, and create detailed response steps for common types of incidents.
Cynet 360 provides all the core capabilities required for sound incident preparation, including a centralized visibility interface showing all endpoint configurations, process execution, installed software, network traffic and user activity.
2. Detection and Analysis
Detection involves collecting data from IT systems, security tools, publicly available information and people inside and outside the organization, and identifying precursors (signs that an incident may happen in the future) and indicators (data showing that an attack has happened or is happening now).
Analysis involves identifying a baseline or normal activity for the affected systems, correlating related events and seeing if and how they deviate from normal behavior.
An integrated security platform like 
Cynet 360 can do this for you, automatically identifying behavioral baselines, detecting anomalies that represent suspicious behavior, and collecting all relevant data across networks, endpoints and users to help you investigate it.
Learn more about how Cynet 360 provides detection capabilities against a wide range of attack vectors with its natively integrated 
EDR , user behavior rules , network detection rules and deception modules.
3. Containment, Eradication, and Recovery
The goal of containment is to stop the attack before it overwhelms resources or causes damage. Your containment strategy will depend on the level of damage the incident can cause, the need to keep critical services available to employees and customers, and the duration of the solutiona temporary solution for a few hours, days or weeks, or a permanent solution.
As part of containment, it is important to identify the attacking host and validate its IP address. This allows you to block communication from the attacker and also identify the threat actor to understand their mode of operation, search for and block other communication channels they may be using.
Cynet 360 can help you take remote manual action to contain security incidents, including stopping malicious processes, deleting files, resetting passwords and restarting affected devices. It can also perform automatic containment actions such as stopping rapid encryption of files or automatically isolating endpoints infected by malware from the network.
Cynet response orchestration capabilities provide the means to terminate attackers presence and activity from all parts of the environment: infected hosts, malicious files, compromised user accounts and attacker-controlled traffic. 
Learn more about Cynet 360s incident containment capabilities .
In the eradication and recovery stage, after the incident has been successfully contained, you should act to remove all elements of the incident from the environment. This might include identifying all affected hosts, removing malware, and closing or resetting passwords for breached user accounts.
Finally, once the threat is eradicated, restore systems and recover normal operations as quickly as possible, taking steps to ensure the same assets are not attacked again.
4. Post-Incident Activity
A central part of the NIST incident response methodology is learning from previous incidents to improve the process.
You should ask, investigate and document the answers to the following questions:
What happened, and at what times?
How well did the incident response team deal with the incident? Were processes followed, and were they sufficient?
What information was needed sooner?
Were any wrong actions taken that caused damage or inhibited recovery?
What could staff do differently next time if the same incident occurred?
Could staff have shared information better with other organizations or other departments?
Have we learned ways to prevent similar incidents in the future?
Have we discovered new precursors or indicators of similar incidents to watch for in the future?
What additional tools or resources are needed to help prevent or mitigate similar incidents?
Use your findings to improve the process, adjust your incident response policy, plan, and procedures, and feed the new data into the preparation stage of your incident response process.
Building Your Own Incident Response Process: Incident Response Plan Templates
One more thing that can save you time as you prepare an incident response plan is to use ready-made templates shared by other organizations. You can adapt these templates to your specific needs.
The following templates can help you get a head start on your incident response plan:

Best Practices for Building Your Incident Response Plan
Create a simple, well-defined process
An incident response plan, even if it is very well thought out, must be simple and crystal clear to be effective. Keep details, procedures and explanations to a minimum to ensure that staff can very easily follow the plan in the urgency and confusion of a real security incident.
Create a communication strategy
Clarify who needs to be informed of a security breach, which communication channels should be used and what level of detail should be provided. There should be clear guidelines on how to inform operations, senior management, affected parties inside and outside the organization, law enforcement, and the press. This is a commonly overlooked part of the incident response process.
Use an incident response plan template
Dont reinvent the wheel. Always start your incident response plan from a template created by others in the industry and adapt it to your specific needs. For example, you can start from this template provided by TechTarget which includes incident scope, planning scenarios, logical sequence of events for incident response, team roles, notification and escalation procedures.
Put your incident response plan to the test
Conduct realistic drills and exercises to see how the incident response plan is carried out in practice, and be ready to adapt the plan according to lessons learned. Test your tools to ensure they are able to detect an attack as early as possible in the kill chain, and ensure the team can identify a threat and contain it before sensitive data leaves your network.
Use a centralized approach
Organizations should not be logging into multiple tools and correlating information between them during the urgency of an attack. Processes and tooling should support a centralized incident response process where an analyst can view all the information about an incident in one place.
Put incident response technology in place
Incident response tools/technology provides you with the means to eradicate discovered malicious presence and activity from your environment as well as optimize response workflows by automating repetitive tasks. They can:
Provide a complete picture of an attack operation, correlating data from endpoints, user behavior and network communications
Enable remote manual response by security analysts, such as blocking users, killing processes, restarting hosts, deleting files or changing password.
Enable automated response , for example automated quarantine of an endpoint when malware is discovered, or automatically stopping a malicious process that encrypts or deletes large numbers of files.

What Is SANS?
The SANS Institute is a private organization established in 1989, which offers research and education on information security. It is the worlds largest provider of security training and certification, and maintains the largest collection of research about cybersecurity. SANS also operates the Internet Storm Center, an early warning system for global cyber threats.
SANS Incident Response Plan
The SANS Institute published a 20-page handbook that lays out a structured 6-step plan for incident response
Preparation
Incident Response Team
Identification
Containment
Eradication
Recovery
Lessons learned
Step 1: Preparation
The goal of the preparation stage is to ensure that the organization can comprehensively respond to an incident at a moments notice.
In a SANS incident response plan, these are critical elements that should be prepared in advance:
Policy
Response Plan/Strategy
Communication
Documentation
Team
Access control
Training
Tools
Leveraging an integrated breach protection platform for incident response
An integrated security platform like 
Cynet 360
Cynet 360 can help your organization perform remote manual action to contain security events. These actions can include deleting files, stopping malicious processes, resetting passwords and restarting devices that have been affected. Cynet can also help your organization carry out measures such as preventing rapid encryption of files or automatically isolating endpoints that have been the target of malware.
Learn more about Cynet 360s incident response capabilities
Step 2: Identification
This step involves detecting deviations from normal operations in the organization, understanding if a deviation represents a security incident, and determining how important the incident is.
The SANS incident response identification procedure includes the following elements:
Setting up monitoring
Analyzing events
Identifying an incident
Notifying CSIRT members strong{Assigning at least two incident responders to a live incident, one as the primary handler who assesses the incident and makes the decision, and the other to help investigate and gather evidence.
Documenting everything
Threat prevention and detection capabilities
Step 3: Containment
The goal of containment is to limit damage from the current security incident and prevent any further damage. Several steps are necessary to completely mitigate the incident, while also preventing destruction of evidence that may be needed for prosecution.
The SANS containment process involves:
Short-term containment
System backup
Long-term containment
Step 4: Eradication
Eradication is intended to actually remove malware or other artifacts introduced by the attacks, and fully restore all affected systems.
The SANS eradication process involves:
Reimaging
Preventing the root cause
Applying basic security best practices
Scan for malware
Step 5: Recovery
The goal of recovery is to bring all systems back to full operation, after verifying they are clean and the threat is removed.
The SANS recovery procedure involves:
Defining time and date to restore operations
Test and verifying
Monitoring
Do everything to prevent another incident
Step 6: Lessons Learned
No later than two weeks from the end of the incident, the CSIRT should compile all relevant information about the incident and extract lessons that can help with future incident response activity.
The SANS lessons learned process includes:
Completing documentation
Publishing an incident report
Identify ways to improve CSIRT performance
Establish a benchmark for comparison
Lessons learned meeting
SANS suggests this general format for the incident report:
When was the problem first detected and by whom
The scope of the incident
How it was contained and eradicated
Worked performed during recovery
Areas where the CIRT teams were effective
Areas that need improvement
Follow the SANS IR Framework with Cynet
Cynet 360 provides powerful capabilities across the three first SANS stages:
Identification  
Cynet EDR network analytics
UEBA deception technology
Containment  Cynet 360 response orchestration
Eradication  Cynet 360 provides complete visibility across all endpoint, user and network activity to accelerate and optimize investigations. It helps responders discover the root cause of an attack, understand its scope and impact, and eliminate malicious infrastructure and activity using its response orchestration

What Does EDR Stand For?
EDR
E
D
R
The primary function of EDR solutions is to alert security teams to malicious activity on endpoints, and enable real-time investigation of the root cause and scope of an attack. EDR has three key mechanisms:
Endpoint data collectionaggregates data on events such as process execution, communication, and user logins.
Detection engineperforms behavioral analysis to establish a baseline of typical endpoint activity, discover anomalies, and determine which anomalies represent malicious activity on the endpoint.
Data recordingprovides security teams with real-time data about security incidents on endpoints, which they can use to investigate an incident in real time, contain and mitigate it.
Endpoint SecurityUnderstanding the Terminology
There are several components to a comprehensive endpoint security solution, and the various associated terms are often confused or conflated. Lets clear up this misunderstanding with precise definitions of the related concepts of EDR, EPP, AV/NGAV, and SIEM.
What is the Difference Between EDR and EPP?
According to Gartner, an 
Endpoint Protection Platform
EPP platform functionality can be divided into two broad categories:
Prevention
Detection and Response
What is the Difference between EDR and Antivirus?
Many people confuse the capabilities of EDR and antivirus (AV), assuming they only need to use one of them. However, these two technologies complement each other. Antivirus is a preventative tool that relies on signature-based detection, and it doesnt provide visibility into how attacks play out. AV can catch the malware, but it doesnt tell you where it came from or how it spread in your network.
EDR, on the other hand, provides a full picture of how an attacker gained access to your system and what they did once inside. EDR can detect malicious activity on an endpoint as a result of zero-day exploits, advanced persistent threats, fileless or malware-free attacks, which dont leave signatures and can therefore evade legacy AV and even NGAV.
What is the Difference Between EDR and SIEM?
Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) collects log and event data from across your network to help identify behavior patterns, detect threats, and investigate security incidents. It is broader than EDR, which addresses endpoint activity specifically.
In a large organization, EDR will likely be one of the data inputs of a SIEM. The SIEM can combine information on endpoint security incidents coming from the EDR system, with information from other parts of the security environment, such as network monitoring and alerts from other security tools.
SIEM is also responsible for collecting historical data, for example recording endpoint data over several years, allowing analysts to see if this type of attack has happened before.
EDR Features
Some common EDR features include:
Endpoint visibility
Data collection
Threat intelligence
Automated alerts and forensics
Trace back to original breach point
Automated response measures on the endpoint

EDR solutions only deal with the process behavior that prompts alerts. Organizations can use EDR tools to attend to specific parts of common Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) attackers use. However, EDR products are blind to other attack types.
Lets turn our attention to the example of credential theft. The default process used by attackers involves dumping password hashes from memory using a customized tool or an open source tool. In this example, the attack method includes anomalous behavior, thus an EDR tool should identify these types of attacks. However, an attacker can acquire the same hashes by scraping the network traffic between two hosts, a process that doesnt include anomalous activity.
A second example involves the attack technique of lateral movement. In this scenario, the attacker may be able to compromise many user account credentials and logs, connected to many hosts in the network. Here, the anomaly is the user activity and not the process behavior. The EDR would thus not identify the attack at all or would see the attack but without sufficient context, and this would trigger false positives. Therefore, process data is important, but organizations cannot rely on it as the only source of their security data.
Another limitation of EDR tools is that they are restricted to endpoints and cannot help mitigate attacks or restore operations at the user or network level.
Cynet 360 holistic cybersecurity solution
Cynet 360 platform is a comprehensive cyber solution that is developed to run in the entire environment of an organization and not only its endpoints. To achieve this Cynet 360 protects all attack surfaces by tracking the three planes; network traffic, process behavior, and user activity. Attackers typically manifest themselves on one or several of these three planes.
Continuous monitoring to detect and stop threats over this triad provides increased threat visibility. Organizations thus have the chance to monitor more stages in the attacks lifecycle so they can identify and block threats with greater success.
As a subset of these capabilities, Cynet employs EDR technology with the following capabilities:
Advanced endpoint threat detection
Investigation and validation
Rapid deployment and response
Cynet 360 threat protection goes beyond attack detection and prevention. Using Cynet organizations can proactively monitor their internal environments, such as endpoints, hosts, files, and network. This can help organizations reduce their attack surface and the potential for multiple attacks. When it comes to active attacks, an organization must work to enclose the capabilities of the attacker to eradicate the presence of the attacker entirely. This includes disabling compromised users, deleting malicious processes and files, isolating infected hosts and blocking traffic controlled by the attacker.
